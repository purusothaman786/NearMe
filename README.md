        <p color="red">The Brahmapureeswarar Temple is a Hindu Temple located in Thirupattur near Trichy, Tamilnadu, India.[1] Worshippers believe that a person can change his fate by seeking the blessings of Brahma and Brahmapureeswarar Shiva Temple, Tirupattur. History
            The god Brahma's overwhelming pride as the Creator of the Universe. Brahma felt that he was more prevailing than Shiva – since he had the supremacy of creation. This sense of pride provoked Shiva, who destroyed Brahma’s Fifth Head, and also
            cursed him that he would lose his power of creation. To relieve himself of this curse, Brahma started out on a pilgrimage of Shiva Temples. During the course of his pilgrimage, Brahma also visited this temple and installed 12 Shiva Lingams
            around Brahmapureeswarar and worshipped Shiva here for a considerable time. Being moved by Brahma's prayers, Shiva, on Devi Parvathi’s appeal, gave him Darshan under the Magizha tree and liberated him from his curse. Shiva also restored the
            power and responsibility of creation to Brahma. Shiva also blessed Brahma that he would have a separate shrine at this temple. He also advised Brahma that since Brahma himself had his destiny rewritten here; he should rewrite the destiny of
            his devotees visiting this temple. Since the fate of Brahma, the Creator, himself was changed by Shiva at Tirupattur, one can expect a turning point in life by praying at this temple. The temple is under the administration of The Hindu Religious
            And Charitable Endowments Department, Government of Tamil Nadu.The Brahmapureeswarar Temple is a Hindu Temple located in Thirupattur near Trichy, Tamilnadu, India.[1] Worshippers believe that a person can change his fate by seeking the blessings
